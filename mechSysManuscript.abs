  We numerically investigated the system response of a circular cylinder-strip plate cruciform oscillator at cruciform angles $\alpha = \angfi{}$, \angfo{}, \angth{}, \angtw{} and \angon{}. We examined the numerical model using the open source C++ library OpenFOAM within Reynolds number $1.1 \times 10^{3} \leq \text{Re} \leq 14.6 \times 10^{3}$. We identified three types of system response from the cruciforms examined: the pure cruciform response with power in the order of \SI{1}{\milli\watt} when reduced velocity $\ured \geq \urse$ and reaches maximum efficiency when $\ured = \urei$, the steep-angled cruciform response with sub-\si{\milli\watt} power output and maximum efficiency when $(\ured,\alpha\,[\si{\degree}]) = (\urtw,\angfo)$, and the shallow-angled cruciform response with power in the order of \SI{10}{\milli\watt} when $\ured \geq \urfo$ and maximum efficiency when $(\ured,\alpha\,[\si{\degree}]) = (\urfo,\angon)$. The high power output from the shallow-angled cruciforms are due to the shedding of three-dimensional Karman vortices seemingly resulting from coalescence of vortex structures shed from the upstream cylinder and downstream strip plate.
